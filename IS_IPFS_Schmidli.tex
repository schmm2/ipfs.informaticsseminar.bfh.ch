\chapter{Abstract}
%https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs, Overview
IPFS (InterPlanetary Filesystem) is an opensource protocol which can be used to run a distributed filesystem. IPFS was invented to tackle the drawbacks of the Internet and the Internetprotocol suite we are using today.\\  \\
To understand why IPFS was invented, we first have to understand the issues we have today. This report will outline how IPFS works, what kind of issues it tries to resolv and analyze the obstacles which have to be overcome to establish IPFS as a accpted and widely used technology.

\chapter{Introduction}
IPFS stands for InterPlanetary Filesystem. It's an opensource Internet Protocol which can be used to run a distributed filesystem.
The developers didn't invent IPFS from scratch. In its core IPFS takes advantage of existing technologies like Kademlia DHT, BitTorrent and Git. The main intention behind IPFS is to tackle the issues  we are having in todays Internet/Web. In the eyes of the inventors the protocol should be seen as an upgrade or even as a replacemnet of the existing technolgies like HTTP. Global data distribution should be simplified and be implemented in the protocol itself rather than prescribe a separate distribution mechnism \cite{IPFSBasics}.

\section{Origin}
% Origin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbenetcs/
The Development of IPFS was started in 2014 by Juan Benet, former Stanford Student and founder of the company Protocol Labs . Protocol Labs and contributors of the Community are developing IPFS further.

\section{Name}
%https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUVmypx9HGI, 4:30
%http://www.internetsociety.org/internet/what-internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet#Origins
The name was choosen as a tribute to J. C. R. Licklider, a computer scientist who came up with an idea of a ''intergalactic network'' of computers in 1962. He imagined a global network of computers, able to talk to each other and exchange data. During his time working at DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) he influenced many peoble with his ideas. DARPA later startet the ARPANET Project and laid the foundation stone for todays Internet. Many important technologies for example: TCP/IP where invented or funded during this project.

\section{Project state}
%https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs#overview, Currrent State of IPFS
As of 19.04.2017 the Specifications of the IPFS Protocol are still being developed and hasn't completed yet. The developers state, that the
 core parts of the specs have reached a reliable or stable state. No RFC request have been submitet. An Implmenetation of the Protocol, written in the programming language Go and some utilities have aready been published. Implementation in other programming languages Javascript and Phyton are in developing.\\

\chapter{Todays Problems}
The developers of IPFS  state: The Internet/Web of today has many issues.  The existing protocols we have today, have some major design issues or are not good enouth anymore to satisfy the needs of todays Web and his Users \cite{TodaysProblems}.


\section{Offline functionality}
Imagine you are sitting with your colleagues at work. You all work together on a document. You are using a WebApplication to collaborate with each other. Suddenly the internet connection is lost. You are all sitting in the same network but you are unable to share your version of the document with the others. All the data needs to be synced with the backbone service for example Google Docs. and then down again to the other clients / your colleagues. The Applications should be able to talk to each other and shouldn't be dependant of a service somewhere in the internet.

\section{Protocol}
The most used Protocol from the Internet Protocol Suite by far is HTTP. It follows the Server-Client communication model. The Client establishes a connection to one server, sends requests and get responses back from the server. Even if there are load balancing mechanisms in place it will be served by the by one host only.\\[0.3cm]
The alternative communication model would be Peer to Peer short. p2p. The Clients establishes a connection to mutlible ''peers'' which will serve the requested data. Every peer will deliver a fraction of the data. Those data ''pieces'' will be downloaded simultainously.

\newpage
\section{Permenancy}
I guess every person which used an Internet Browser before has seen a message like ''Error 404'' or ''Site not found''.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/github-404.png}
\caption[Github 404 Error Page]{Github 404 Error Page}
\end{figure}
\noindent
The specific content you tried to reach has been deletet or has been moved by the sites provider. All the links provided are now useless. Every day content gets moved around or is deleted forever. Sometimes its just a silly picture of a cat but mostly its data somebody actually would have needed.\\[0.3cm]
Nevertheless there are several companies already trying to solve this issue by archiving all the data available on the internet. The most well known would be ''Internet Archive'' with its ''Wayback Machine'' Webapplikation. They are using web crawlers to get the data and store them. The User is able to use theWayback Machine to view the webpage back then when the Internet Archive made a snapshot of it \cite{InternetArchive}. By October 2016 they managed to archive 273 billion webpages from over 361 million websites, which resulted in a data size of 15 Petabytes (15'000 Terabytes) \cite{InternetArchiveCount}.

\newpage

\section{Centralization \& Proxy}
Big data hosting companies like Google or Amazon own datacenters worldwide. Developer can buy the service from them to cluster their application data  and distrbute it all over the world. This ensures the availability of your Application even in case of a datacenter outage caused by a natural catastrophe or other technical issues. Those incidents aren't fictions and cost millions if they happen. Latest example, 28.02.2107 a site of the Amazon S3 System located in Northern Virginia gots unavailable. Thousands of webpages and webapplications stopped working. A Amazon technican wantet to remove a small subset of servers. He entered the command wrong and more servers than planned were removed. This led to an 4h outage of the hole Site \cite{AWSOutage}. Estimated cost 150 Million US Dollar \cite{AWSOutageCost}.\\\\
Clustering of data is not standard today. To make your data highly available is cost intensive. To achieve the same level of high availability cost effective without any kind of big service provider like Google is near impossible.\\\\
A second group of big data handlers are the so called CDNs. These Content Delivery Networks host data worldwide and act as a proxy for data requests. Services of these providers are used to bring content closer to the customers to reduce latency and download time.

\section{Security}
Man in the middle, armor the content not the tunnel

\section{Privacy \& Consumer Protection}
In these days one of the main concerns of social media platforms are privacy issues and hate messages. Those companies, for example Facebook and Twitter, are facing huge fines in several countries because goverments think they don't do enouth to protect their users. \cite{HateSpeech}. Content shared with a service in the internet, mostly stayes in the internet as its rapidly shared and distributed. If it's out there it's out there forerver. The content itself is hard to locate and remove. The data is adressed with links. The links or URL changes from hoster to hoster. If the affacted user tries to notify the hoster of the data, for example a picture with the intetion to damage the users reputation, it might alread be hosted by several other platforms.

\subsection{Multihash}
Multihash is another protocol invented and maintened by the company Protocol Labs. This protocol is used in the IPFS project to store Hashes. Every hash generated will be stored with two addidtional values; the ID of hash function, which was used to generate this hash and the length of the hash.
\begin{center}
	Multihash Format = Hash Function ID + Hash Length + Hash
\end{center}
The Hash function IDs were set by the developers
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/multiformat_hashfunctionid.png}
\end{center}
\begin{exmp} sha3-256, 20

\end{exmp}

\section{Identities}
All computers participating in an IPFS Network are called peers or nodes.\\
During the initialization of a node, a 2048-bit RSA keypair (public, private) is generated. The multihash function is used to generate the hash of the public key. This generated hash is then used as Peer ID \cite{PeerID}. OOOOOR S/Kademlia’s static crypto puzzle
\begin{center}
Peer ID = multihash(public key)
\end{center}

\subsection{Trust}
There is no central certification authority in place which can be used to check if another peer can be trusted. The hole system has been designed to be self-verifing. As usual in a public private key environment, data exchanged between the peers is always encrypted using the public key of the target peer.
\begin{exmp}
Peer A contatcs another peer B. The Nodes exchange Node ID and Public Key.
Peer A generates the hash of the public key of peer B. If this generated hash doesn't mach the NodeID of peer B the connection will be terminated.\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/ipfs_peerstrust_scenario_a.png}
\end{center}
\end{exmp}

\newpage
Scenario B. \\
Peer c tries to steal the identity of peer a. Peer c is using the public key from peer a and the coresponding PeerID. Peer b will establish a connection with peer c as the public key is valid and the PeerID matches. The sent data from b to c will be encrypted by Peer a's public key. As Peer c doesnt hold the private key, the data can't be encrypted and therefor its useless.
 

\chapter{Data Handling}
Compared to HTTP where data is adressed by URL's is IPFS the data is adressed by its contents hash.\\
To understand how the data adressing in IPFS works, first a little example how its done with HTTP.
\section{Data Adressing}
\subsection{HTTP}
Data which is access by HTTP is adressd with its hostname, port, path and the filename or searchword \cite{HTTPAdressing}.
\begin{exmp} URL schema used for HTTP
\noindent
\begin{center}
http : // hostname [ : port ] / path [ ? searchwords ]\\
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/TeX.gitignore
\end{center}
\end{exmp}
\noindent
If the location of the file changes and no redirection was created, the link gets useless.
\noindent
\subsection{IPFS}
IPFS goes a different way. Data added to the global IPFS can be adressed by the hash of its content. When the content of the file changes so does the hash value. The changed content will be added to the Network. The older content will still be accessible with the old hash value. This garanties the persistance and the versioning of the data.
\begin{exmp} Add a file\\[0.3cm]
	We create a demo file\\[0.3cm]
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/addFile01.png}\\[0.3cm]
	We add the file foo.txt to the IPFS Network. The content gets hashed and creates an key to this specific data. \textbf{QmYNmQKp6SuaVrpgWRsPTgCQCnpxUYGq76YEKBXuj2N4H6} is the key to our file with the content ''foo''.\\[0.3cm]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/addFile02.png}\\[0.3cm]
	This hash value cann now be used to access the content from any IPFS client. Example with cat\\[0.3cm]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/addFile03.png}\\[0.3cm]
	Let's change the content of ''foo.txt''.\\[0.3cm]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/addFile04.png}\\[0.3cm]
	Add the file again. Because we changed the content, the hash value will be different this time.
	New Key: \textbf{QmbYzb3nScopAnfkoUpRWUFVv856uSWpSRc2KYM1FSBJxr}\\[0.3cm] 
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/addFile05.png}
\end{exmp}
\noindent \\[0.3cm]
The system is activly deduplicating data. If existing contents gets added for example two times the same picture they will get the same hash value, but the raw data wil be stored just once in the IPFS network.
\begin{exmp}Deduplicating\\[0.3cm]
	We add two files, same content but different names \textbf{foo2.txt} and \textbf{foo3.txt} with the content \textbf{''new Foo''}\\[0.3cm]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/addFile06.png}\\[0.3cm]
	Both times the generated hash is \\ \textbf{QmYxEG2M5LhqPwoRXhvhTWPVKtapZNXMHtL1TgPypgqNDK}
\end{exmp}

\newpage
\section{Mutability - IPNS}
All the data added to the IPFS Network is immutable means they can't be changed anymore. New content generates a new commit and therefor a new hash key. If you change your data other peoble, with the old hask key (link) will always be directed to the old version of the file. To solve this issue, the developers created the InterPlanatery Naming System (IPNS). IPNS
